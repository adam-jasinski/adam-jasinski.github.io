<p>Javais ahigh-level,general-purpose,memory-safe,object-orientedprogramming language. It is intended to letprogrammerswrite once, run anywhere(WORA),[16]meaning thatcompiledJava code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17]Java applications are typically compiled tobytecodethat can run on anyJava virtual machine(JVM) regardless of the underlyingcomputer architecture. Thesyntaxof Java is similar toCandC++, but has fewerlow-levelfacilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such asreflectionand runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.</p>

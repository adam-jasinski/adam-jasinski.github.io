<p>COBOL(/ˈkoʊbɒl,-bɔːl/; anacronymfor “common business-oriented language”) is acompiledEnglish-likecomputer programming languagedesigned for business use. It is animperative,procedural, and, since 2002,object-orientedlanguage. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in applications deployed onmainframe computers, such as large-scalebatchandtransaction processingjobs. Many large financial institutions were developing new systems in the language as late as 2006,[10]but most programming in COBOL today is purely to maintain existing applications. Programs are being moved to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages, or replaced with other software.[11]</p>

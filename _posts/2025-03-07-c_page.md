C(pronounced/ˈsiː/– like the letterc)[6]is ageneral-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s byDennis Ritchieand remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targetedCPUs. It has found lasting use inoperating systemscode (especially inkernels[7]),device drivers, andprotocol stacks, but its use inapplication softwarehas been decreasing.[8]C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largestsupercomputersto the smallestmicrocontrollersandembedded systems.
